21st & 3rd STORE OPENING ANALYSIS — QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================

Store: 21st & 3rd (shop_no: US00020)
Opening: February 6, 2026 (Friday, 12:06 PM)
Data Coverage: 6 days (Feb 6 - Feb 11, 2026)

================================================================================
ANSWER: Is opening day traffic better than subsequent days?
================================================================================

YES, but MINIMAL boost compared to other stores.

English:
Opening day achieved 298 cups (half-day operation, 12 PM - midnight).
This is 47% higher than the average of subsequent days (203 cups).
Opening-to-average ratio: 1.47x

However, when comparing to weekdays only (excluding weekend dip),
the opening boost is minimal — Tuesday Feb 10 matched opening day at 296 cups.

Chinese (中文):
开业日完成298杯（半天营业，中午12点至午夜）。
比后续天数平均高47%（后续平均203杯）。
开业比率: 1.47倍

但如果仅比较工作日（排除周末低谷），开业提升很小 —
2月10日周二达到296杯，与开业日基本持平。

================================================================================
KEY COMPARISONS
================================================================================

1. Opening Day vs. Day 2 (Saturday)
   298 cups vs. 156 cups (+91% higher)

2. Opening Day vs. First Weekend Average
   298 cups vs. 151 cups (+98% higher)

3. Opening Day vs. Subsequent Days Average

4. Opening Day vs. Next Tuesday (Feb 10)
   298 cups vs. 296 cups (+1% higher) → essentially the same

5. Daily Trend:
   Stable — no post-opening collapse
   Pattern: Opening 298 → Weekend dip 145-156 → Weekday recovery 208-296

================================================================================
HOURLY PATTERN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Opening day had a concentrated 4 PM rush:
- 4 PM: 59 cups (19.8% of daily traffic) — opening promotion effect
- Subsequent weekdays average at 4 PM: 24 cups

Afternoon peak (2-6 PM) was inflated on opening day: 185 cups (62% of daily)
Subsequent days show more balanced distribution with stronger evening (8-10 PM)

Conclusion: Opening day rush was concentrated in afternoon hours.
Subsequent days normalized with better evening performance.

COMPARISON TO 8-STORE ANALYSIS BENCHMARK
================================================================================

Metric                    | 21st & 3rd | 8-Store Median | Difference
--------------------------|------------|----------------|------------
Opening-to-Avg Ratio      | 1.47x      | 1.34x          | +10% above median
Opening Day Cups          | 298        | 506            | -41% (smaller store)
Subsequent Days Avg       | 203        | 380            | -47% (smaller store)
Trend Pattern             | Stable     | 63% decline    | Much better
Weeks of Data             | <1 week    | 4-32 weeks     | Limited data

Findings:
✓ Opening ratio (1.47x) is close to fleet median (1.34x) — consistent pattern
✓ Smaller store (200-300 cups/day vs. 380 fleet average)
✓ No post-opening collapse — traffic is stable (good sign)
✗ Limited data (only 6 days) — need 4+ weeks to confirm trend

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For 21st & 3rd Management:
1. Monitor Friday Feb 13 performance to establish baseline weekday traffic
2. Weekend traffic (145-156 cups) is low — consider weekend promotions
3. Evening traffic (8-10 PM) is growing — capitalize on late-night crowd
4. Stable performance is good — maintain current operations

For Future Openings:
1. 21st & 3rd pattern (1.47x) is healthy — moderate boost without hype
2. Half-day opening worked well (298 cups in 12 hours = strong run rate)
3. Weekday strength (200-300 cups) is promising for long-term
4. No "novelty collapse" — unlike stores with extreme opening ratios

================================================================================
DATA LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

⚠️ Only 6 days of data — statistical significance is limited
⚠️ Half-day opening (12 PM start) makes comparison difficult
⚠️ No Friday comparison yet (Feb 13 data needed)
⚠️ Feb 11 data incomplete (only through 7:57 PM)
⚠️ Unknown if opening day had special promotions

Follow-up: Re-analyze after 4+ weeks (by March 6, 2026)
